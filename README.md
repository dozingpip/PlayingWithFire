# Welcome to Hell!
## If you'd like to leave, I suggest you do the following:
1. Start by making a gold farm. Zombified Piglins only spawn on magma blocks. It doesn't have to be very efficient, you'll get better tools to make it more efficent as you go.
2. Start doing some piglin bartering.
3. Make a puny smeltery.![top left block: seared melter, top right: seared faucet, bottom left: seared tank, bottom right: casting basin](puny_smeltery.png "Your first smeltery. It's puny.")
4. Melt weeping and twisting vines for copper and zinc.
5. Your way to the Create mod is now open, the underworld is your oyster, etc!
6. ???
7. Profit!
8. ???
9. Make a portal with the obsidian you've painstakingly created.
10. Leave the Nether.
11. Profit more? dunno, the overworld is your oyster now I suppose.

## Notes from previous denizens
As you can't get your precious water in the nether, you'll have to create your botanical masterpieces in quite an unusual manner... mostly by brewing tea with the usual smattering of petals and runes.

Crops don't seem to grow very well, or at all, in the Nether either, but there is another way... Explosives! That's right, explode your seeds along with some bone meal to instantaniously grow them. Much more convenient than the normal way, not to mention entertaining. Too bad there's no way to get corn, popcorn would be great.

Hmm, it seems that whenever I try to make a portal to Alfheim it connects up to some sort of underwater elfen village in the overworld? I can get quite a few useful items by trading with them.

Want to listen to some tunes? Try combustive fishing! You just might get your very own copy of Pigstep, or any other disc.
## Modpack Info
In case it was not clear, the end goal is to create a Nether portal.

This is a small, goal-oriented skyblock modpack where a big focus is on Nether mob farming. That and Piglin bartering is where all your resources will come from. No sitting around sifting gravel or working away at a cobble generator. There are even ways to craft certain spawn eggs! *See uses of turtle egg.*

Create and Botania are your main ways to automate anything. No one-block solutions here.

There are no quests, but there is an in-game guidebook to help get you started and it has tips for if/when you feel stuck!

The grind is kept low, especially if you automate as you go.

### Mobs will only spawn on certain blocks
- zombified piglins: magma blocks
- piglins: netherrack
- endermen: soul sand
- blaze: quartz blocks
- wither skeletons: nether bricks
- etc

The Piglin bartering loot table has also been modified, see uses of gold ingot for all the possibilities.

*P.S. Don't eat the fish. If you eat the fish anyway, I told you so! :p*
