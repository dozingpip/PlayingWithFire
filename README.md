# Welcome to Hell!
1. Start by making a gold farm. Zombified Piglins only spawn on magma blocks. It doesn't have to be very efficient, you will get better tools to make it more efficent as you go.
2. Set up some piglin bartering.
3. Craft a Seared Melter, Seared Tank, Seared Faucet, and Casting Basin, place as seen below:
![top left block: seared melter, top right: seared faucet, bottom left: seared tank, bottom right: casting basin](puny_smeltery.png "Your first smeltery. It's puny.")
4. Melt weeping and twisting vines to get molten copper and molten zinc respectively. Melt blackstone and cast it onto blackstone for andesite.
5. Your way to the Create mod is now open, the underworld is your oyster, etc!
6. ???
7. Profit!
8. ???
9. Make a portal with obsidian.
10. Leave the Nether.
11. Profit more? idk, the overworld is your oyster now I guess.

## Piglin bartering can now get you:
- awkward potion
- black lotus, Concentrated mana from Botania. Throw it in a non-empty mana pool to use it.
- turtle egg, Useful for making your gold farm more efficient. Also used in various spawn egg recipes.
- soul sand
- gravel
- blackstone
- quartz
- iron nugget
This info has been added in JEI as well. See uses of gold ingot, or how to make any of the above items.

## Mobs will only spawn on certain blocks:
- zombified_piglins: magma blocks
- piglins: netherrack
- endermen: soul sand/soul soil
- blaze: quartz blocks
- wither skeletons: nether bricks
- ghast: gravel
- magma cube: crimson hyphae
- hoglins: crimson nylium
- Nothing spawns on any other blocks
- Zombified piglins can spawn 5-100 blocks away from the player. All other mobs can spawn 20-100 blocks away from the player.
- Item drop rates have generally been increased

PS. Don't eat the fish. If you eat the fish anyway, I told you so! :p
