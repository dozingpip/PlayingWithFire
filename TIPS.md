Mobs will only spawn on certain blocks:
zombified_piglins: magma blocks
piglins: netherrack
endermen: soul sand/soul soil
blaze: quartz blocks
wither skeletons: nether bricks
ghast: gravel
magma cube: crimson hyphae
hoglins: crimson nylium
Nothing spawns on warped nylium (or any other blocks that I also haven't mentioned)

Start by making a gold farm. It doesn't have to be very efficient, you will get tools to make it more efficent as you go.
You can get turtle eggs from piglin bartering.
Set up auto piglin bartering.

Very useful, but their use is not required:
construction wand
tape measure
storage drawers + drawer controller
waystones
combustive fishing rod (fishing rod used on lava)
