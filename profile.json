(A new take on the Builder's Wand)","body":"# Construction Wand\n\nWith a Construction Wand you can place multiple blocks (up to 1024) at once, extending your build on the side you're\nfacing. If that's not enough: you can upgrade your wand with additional cores, allowing you to place a block behind the\nblock you are facing, conjure blocks in mid air or destroy lots of blocks very fast.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/images/c9dc4b40da63d535f90020335804e089addb5896.png)\n\n**Note:** These are the instructions for ConstructionWand version 2.0+, which introduced some new features.\nIf you are still using version 1.x, refer to [those](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/tree/1.16.2-1.7)\ninstructions.\n\n## Wands\n\nThere are basic wands made from stone, iron and diamond and the Infinity wand. Wands from higher tiers are more powerful\nand last longer. These properties can be changed in the config.\n\n| Wand     | Durability  | Max. Blocks | Upgradeable | Angel distance | Max. Blocks (Destroy) |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Stone    | 131         | 9           | No          | -              | -                     |\n| Iron     | 250         | 27          | Yes         | 1              | 9                     |\n| Diamond  | 1561        | 128         | Yes         | 4              | 25                    |\n| Infinity | Unbreakable | 1024        | Yes         | 8              | 81                    |\n\n## Crafting\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting1.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting2.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting3.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting4.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting5.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting6.png)\n\n## Keybindings\n\nTo change a wand's core and options or undo your placement you need to hold down the wand option key\n(refered as OPTKEY). By default, this is CTRL, but it can be changed in the client config file. To prevent unwanted\nchanges to your options, you can configure that you have to hold down SNEAK as well to change options or open up the\nGUI.\n\n## Wand cores\n\nWand cores are magical gemstones that make your wand do its thing.\n\nEvery wand comes with a Construction core. You can make your wand even better by putting\naditional cores into it. Put your new core together with your wand in a\ncrafting grid to install it. To switch between cores, hold down OPTKEY and left click empty space\nwith your wand.\nStone wands can't be upgraded.\n\n**Construction core**\n\nExtend your build on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nHold down OPTKEY and scroll to change placement restriction\n(Horizontal, Vertical, North/South, East/West, No lock).\n\n**Angel core**\n\nPlace a block on the opposite side of the block (or row of blocks) you are facing. Maximum distance depends\non wand tier. Right click empty space to place a block in midair (similar to angel blocks, hence the name).\nTo do that, you'll need to have the block you want to place in your offhand. You can't place a block in midair\nif you've fallen more than 10 blocks deep (no easy rescue tool from falling into the void).\n\n**Destruction core**\n\nDestroy blocks (no tile entities) on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nRestrictions work just like with the Construction core. Destroyed blocks disappear into the void,\nyou can use the undo feature if you've made a mistake.\n\n## Options\nSNEAK+OPTKEY+Right clicking empty space opens the option screen of your wand.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/options.png)\n\n**Restriction:** If restriction is enabled the wand will only place blocks in one row or column\n(choose between North/South, East/West on a horizontal plane and Horizontal, Vertical on a vertical plane).\nIf the direction lock is switched off, the wand will extend the entire face of the building it's pointed at. This option\nhas no effect if the angel core is enabled.\n\n**Direction:** If set to \"Player\" the wand places blocks in the same direction as if they were placed by yourself.\nTarget mode places the blocks in the same direction as their supporting block. See the picture below:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/placedir.png)\n\n**Replacement:** Enables/disables the replacement of replaceable blocks (Fluids, snow, tallgrass).\n\n**Matching:** Select which blocks are extended by the wand. If set to \"EXACT\" it will only extend blocks that\nare exactly the same as the selected block.<br>\n\"SIMILAR\" will treat similar blocks equally (e.g. extend dirt and grass blocks).<br>\n\"ANY\" will extend any block on the face of the building you're looking at.\n\n**Random:** If random mode is enabled, the wand places random blocks from your hotbar.<br>\n~~Shamelessly stolen~~ Inspired by the Trowel from Quark.\n\n## Undo\n\nHolding down Sneak+OPTKEY while looking at a block will show you the last blocks you placed with a green border around\nthem. Sneak+OPTKEY+Right clicking any of them will undo the operation, giving you all the items back. If you used the\nDestruction core, it will restore the blocks.\n\n## Additional features\n\n- Shulker boxes, bundles (MC 1.17+) and many containers from other mods can provide building blocks for the wand\n\n- Botania compatibility: The Black Hole Talisman can supply blocks just like shulker boxes can. Having a Rod of the\n  Lands / Rod of the Depths in your inventory will provide you with infinite dirt/cobble at the cost of Mana.\n\n- Having blocks in your offhand will place them instead of the block you're looking at\n\n- Look at your statisics to see how many blocks you have placed using your wand\n\n- **1.16+ only:** The Infinity Wand won't burn in lava just like netherite gear.\n\n- Ingame documentation with Just Enough Items (JEI)\n\n## TileEntity Blacklist\n\nSome modded TileEntitys can cause issues when placed using a wand. They may turn into invisible and\nunremovable ghost blocks, become unbreakable or cause other unwanted effects.\n\nThat's why I've included a Black/Whitelist system\nfor TileEntities in CW Version 1.7. Chisels&Bits blocks are blacklisted by default.\nThere are probably a few other tile entities from other mods out there which may cause issues as well.\nIf you find some of them you can tell me by creating\nan issue, commenting on Curse or editing the default blacklist yourself\n(it is located at https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/blob/1.19/src/main/java/thetadev/constructionwand/basics/ConfigServer.java#L25)\nand making a PR.\n","published":"2023-02-12T15:35:19.530389Z","updated":"2023-10-22T13:16:37.001996Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":155935,"followers":48,"categories":["equipment"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["rrqylZBD","3ot5Oyha","mu10EfcP","igLNVPcs","9MN5qjpv","Sm161M7C","NiITg4f7","L2xX0NNB","wOUcCQZq","En39T7ce","oYFaTF5x","5sOBinxu","aHdfYfXB","euErdk9r","MQCbEsYE","XCgKj8gL","hOOCABkw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/97e36b528d64cde8be387379f2768eddac003c89.png"},"version":{"id":"XCgKj8gL","project_id":"bV2crgLh","author_id":"5Q6TFGke","featured":false,"name":"Construction Wand 1.20.1-2.11","version_number":"1.20.1-2.11","changelog":"**ConstructionWand 2.11**\nNow available for MC 1.20\n\n- Fixed [#76](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/issues/76) Logic issue with placement\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-05T20:03:02.535254Z","downloads":127923,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"80bd5223cd8984dc1038cb9f2d1cb6b97f31998a","sha512":"a029f801dbcfacd230650fd018f7424535454fb2062d796cbe9cd622a9fe4ae80cb0d7883faa2775c27ed73a21dffbadb44ddc32ce1293ec098654393e7b1c95"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/versions/XCgKj8gL/constructionwand-1.20.1-2.11.jar","filename":"constructionwand-1.20.1-2.11.jar","primary":true,"size":210312,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"e9S8rgYI","user":{"id":"5Q6TFGke","username":"theta-dev","name":"ThetaDev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19636565?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-24T15:23:28.923449Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"constructionwand-1.20.1-2.11.jar"},"mods\\Patchouli-1.20.1-84-FORGE.jar":{"sha512":"c38eb664bf5a0a9552e01e790b43a60551e2286309042ec2f71c5abd7881975623f0409c49b12db1d74db497e678cd74061d9e8d6b6d4d363cd3747eca8da25d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nU0bVIaL","slug":"patchouli","project_type":"mod","team":"72JcM90m","title":"Patchouli","description":"Accessible, Data-Driven, Dependency-Free Documentation for Minecraft Modders and Pack Makers","body":"[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm0.png)](https://violetmoon.org)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm1.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm2.png)](https://twitter.com/vazkiimods)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm3.png)](https://discord.gg/vm)\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/hero/patchouli.png)\n\n---\n\n# About\n\n**Patchouli** is a mod that aims to provide easy to implement, data-driven documentation for minecraft modders and modpack makers alike.\n\nPatchouli's systems allow any modder or modpack maker to quickly create beautiful books full of user experience enhancing features.

Obliterator","description":"Modpack utility mod that allows to disable items and/or its interactions. Also removes them from creative tabs, recipes, trades, and JEI/REI/EMI.","body":"Disable unwanted items from existing using JSON configuration.\n\n- Supports Fabric/Quilt 1.19.2 - 1.20.X, 1.21\n\n- Supports Forge 1.19.2 - 1.20.1\n\n- Supports NeoForge 1.20.1\n\n## Features\n\n\n- **Inventory Removal.** The Item won't be held or dropped anymore, it will be removed if exists.\n- **Creative Tab Removal.** The Item won't appear in the respective creative tab it was.\n- **Trade Removal.** All trades involving the item will be removed from villagers.\n- **Recipe Removal.** Removes all recipes (Crafting, furnaces, and custom mod recipes).\n- **NBT Removal.** Remove specific potions, enchanted books, or anything!\n- **REI Integration.** Banned items won't appear in REI.\n- **EMI Integration.** Banned items won't appear in EMI.\n- **JEI Integration.** Banned items won't appear in JEI.\n- **Regex Support.** Save yourself time by using regular expressions.\n- **Optimized.** Item Obliterator will never cause lag! And can be used as an optimization tool if certain items cause lag.\n\n### Specific Configs\n- **Disable Items Completely.** You can blacklist items to be removed with all features above.\n- **Disable Only Specific NBT in Items.** You can blackliist items that have specific NBT tags. Works with regex too!\n- **Disable Only Item Attacks.** You can blacklist items to only disable its attacks.\n- **Disable Only Item Interaction.** You can blacklist items to only disable interactions (Right-Click).\n- **Disable Only Recipes.** You can blacklist recipes only if they contain the item.\n \n\n## FAQ\n\n\n- **Can I use this in my modpack?**\n  \nOf course! It was designed for modpack creators to remove undesired items that may unbalance the game or create issues.\n\n \n\n- **Client or server?**\n\nThe mod is needed on both client and server. As it has some client features, but also server ones.\n\nCan work server-side only, but JEI/REI/EMI and creative tab removals won't work.\n\n \n\n- **What if I mispell an item ID in the config file?**\n\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the item won't be blacklisted as it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n\n\n## Example Configuration:\n\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each item you want to obliterate.\n\nItems can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:golden_apple\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"item_obliterator.json5\" (>=2.0.0) or \"item_obliterator.json\" (< 2.0.0)\n\n![Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050578253489917992/1197387350930620456/image.png)","published":"2023-04-27T01:18:17.693047Z","updated":"2024-06-27T22:48:26.093505Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":295745,"followers":143,"categories":["management"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","optimization","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["wStgh7KF","Z7O1PDF6","DhBs53zu","apfGL9jJ","TF654Ypi","hvb70HnH","pdDz3IHw","OgSArgH9","C1RqeDeY","9VoRHOKh","AttOhwKN","3Da2NymJ","PPE0fiKq","YOjk8208","XEnZel0q","pJbzX1XF","HBSgjdKo","1FeDblKK","7wB98NiB","IfKpXjEk","jN8eVPiJ","QsH3oZB7","OqMP9ZL0","veDPhmBN","tl9Z9uga","EV0cDZhI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3ESR84kR/1da8db99e7f41f033f9d1437c50d42646b2aff7b.png"},"version":{"id":"EV0cDZhI","project_id":"3ESR84kR","author_id":"Kp5oK4eX","featured":false,"name":"Item

It is based on a rule system. The rule files are located in `config/incontrol`.\n\nThere are currently five rule files (as of 3.5.1):\n- **`spawn.json`:** with this file you can block spawning of certain creatures under certain conditions. In addition, when a spawn is allowed you can also alter some of the properties of the mob like maximum health and others\n- **`summonaid.json`:** this is a file that is structured the same as `spawn.json` but is only used when zombies are summoned for aid\n- **`potentialspawn.json (1.12 only)`:** with this file you can remove and add spawn rules under certain conditions. The rules in this file are used before the rules in `spawn.json` are fired so make sure that when you add a rule for new mobs here, the new mobs are allowed in `spawn.json`\n- **`spawner.json (1.16 or later)`:** with this file you can add spawn rules under certain conditions\n- **`loot.json`:** with this file you can control the loot that mobs drop when they are killed based on various criteria\n- **`experience.json`:** with this file you can control how much experience you get from killing mobs based on various criteria\n\nMore in-depth documentation can be found on [the In Control!

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open

Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

recipes, add new custom items, script world events, all in JavaScript!","body":"# KubeJS\n\n---\n\n## What does this mod do?\nThis mod lets you create scripts in JavaScript language to manage your server, add new blocks and items, change recipes and tags, add custom handlers for quest mods, change worldgen and more!\n\n## How to use it?\nRun the game with mod installed once. It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lat) and ask for help in one of the `#support` channels!\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)","published":"2022-05-24T16:43:25.500518Z","updated":"2024-08-15T10:39:41.063056Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":483213,"followers":155,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["OcFX4nHs","Ow98nGVX","FF8NfrgL","auubUS2M","Ixibh2TH","De5QS1RH","MFMrkWVK","1DHeFXgn","kyfvtCdx","LOIuik1U","bFZ8ZHpg","DOjY3yyC","806o7Suw","2Ct4a66V","ULXqIHYa","tKESRatJ","LNkX71jp","bwEXdOWs","KsTEzm3Y","mBALmsWY","cHTfp1UP","9s0MLCAB","sJj6ohgk","Ub4Symjo","npLops7n","yOVZYRKr","E8fQ0dKc","Qp5ZRXjM","PPvjWEfj","A9s7ueHB","F5VxKMBz","f14qa9sy","RNgVGXaY","vK2FAy5R","weBfYafA","feWz4dEs","bwX6yAak","nfDOk0yl","sGWK5Cnk","k2oqHlKS","kBiXtuN1","fGfJQ5rR","eYrIY0qL","wcRzE7tU","BYb2BvzM","jxO06aq5","9G1ElIy0","P7hkDGrH","W3d8ybuy","SWoVFlyf","dFL3FSdz","RBhCJrS0","Yur4mvDX","9UV0zszK","NR9IZOGJ","sX3BpsBI","9VeL4ZZ6","vgx0c1hI","o4MMDsV7","jCixe3kd","1nWDH5qG","EK4hUkCs","RXnprv2l","Rv97APAO","DBKRffZ4","YXPotrX4","Kyktn61M","lew7kmbd","xXAtessU","Tz27arVB","CCikQblc","UMZ1m981","A7djo8T2","cdhFKlyb","pVXrO4kU","tLGefQzt","8mbTmr71","FPGVlGMe","StSjSm2P","izefEKjA","A8sfF3LI","ZWmvVA5h","UTCcO2su","t9fe5vfh","1Qy5cVlI","Ampn5FKW","6BC6Xk60","3bYeOdl5","s19lY1bm","vj81wZ1c","7OpTGCA4","AZWg88gR","uJhPvRKK","xqujXePu","GBMZypIu","DwdB5XhG","7jTB75Db","CNACrDhA","w2r2O4Zk","wyA5RDMS","F01IIkPe","Mx62BVNQ","qZOd7jFw","MWY9RHwp","uqzp42or","LCoZUlvd","QBRXfyxz","5V4W4J31","ZA00gaxh","bFNvcZyN","rDkfy6da","GY6F8z9w","GPQY9mAV","n4x8yoH4","VPvo5sT3","uxjmmuqY","2Esx1zg8","8gps0YQi","7HLO2GmW","yBny0apG","7CFPwodQ","PjWYlZ5c","I10EdBq5","d3qJHe7E","Tq05LivK","ote14uu7","H2vngs52","1ky29Gsi","RCatfhz4","ehx18Fp4","D9tF4vlU","pZIQNE9z","TSy6UYgH","MngQb49Q","EqeCAvlH","fn942sgr","TsHW75Jn","cNTjEyPk","N8NhOVVu","Uftc1Dwa","I3d1VHRy","DRL1lKcl","5R96tZZJ","nqZhRK2i","lkxC8tyT","NxiPZcjn","taSTLnpE","ZmFr8OyA","DurEi6ex","vvU3HhTY","labPOb8A","ed4plH3N","yipsDsjO","YUEUsB7q","BbS1cViy","bdW1nNAt","BDJ2GEpL","d9bWRMz2","sFpbAQ2a","xegTUYsk","vwFRBYnc","vt0ez0LX","P6hcZCCH","1gQMBkSK","gh9yWBde","eiPloPKr","t8o5J3BD","vVYwDUA6","BoIp8lm2","iF0WVI8W","wkXmARVM","Suz1uvbT","UiUUWj3r","gA76TcEp","GDNXKEu5","gu4PZc7f","n2Fo5flv","wJu56TZy","vuvvvfaq","gR2kKjfQ","4GmFSLDy","5g6sbfti","3GTpfbwF","Gy4SMtXg","QT3xVJkt","ql8tFeNL","x4ae14RZ","qxwQqfSt","x0Hrk4nK","otShvOU3","SS4CGTjR","S86HbemZ","EPE77ai4","9qImBd17","WHYMSJMD","kRi0ufS8","su6z8xGc","LrqRkwYn","HyhAUPCb","4XUnHFmL","FhFpns22","Ido8wzDQ","2CO9gGTI","SQQeQSTn","tjHJUplK","zTmYcmhM","LyNDppEw","CvAD2tfB","59Rrnrig","Rw4OzLJv","t6q6ZcGH","QNkzy03H","pqsRIbGd","5IvA63vq","WyBHyQyZ","CpVHVzDD","AyaKZkLA","P1yh6SA4","cjTSQs7l","BcSvYhCr","EAnnTvXu","3Iy2WFrX","Hxxo2Kpa","3YQy2V8y","5qy1hhpA","QJpJdBpe","MJZU8kaa","oWvMwdEd","u2E6nM8j","DzTmQxTL","8sklNhbB","Wm8El7LP","Bz4Mr8SC","BVXQLdQ3","eglFBoXy","KWo6F7SH","24g9epzG","1na6fpcK","5oww6GkH","Br93DtM2","nCDrdaJa","MFP0ghCh","O5hHoLyJ","lmLSVeVQ","csaRR7jH","O2HcV5Yb","ts2tuODL","2b2BZMEa","xVlVOnAm","NW7QZfiS","cHMGZLvr","sG7Ike2a","ihUTVWcl","SC4rFj0x","ASf2URzd","ZRZ3cwM8","blhoxfHJ","DNX6SE7o","oaioaI0w","XwkVpW1I","j6kmkTxA","YAwgjR2e","kDo2gW7l","Sl2X7VIn","yfRtORZX","3UnN1fUR","hEKh2XsX","e3sfelca","ByN6240z","XFk8J9v0","scg4828e","AhYGbfUn","fJWI4KgO","f8iCIWX6","bhl0EGXi","KB3ccDeS","6GDXRg72","d7gZelP5","PJFpTiIm","epbC9vYw","DVyNPewd","W7TsDGpq","ZwoTeC0E","by2RKW7U","xJG7Udcq","AHOgGRJp","nwyIEToX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/umyGl7zF/da8c1b919062be5d66af2e9fbb63c3726fe86614.png"},"version":{"id":"AhYGbfUn","project_id":"umyGl7zF","author_id":"7tgPcl7v","featured":false,"name":"KubeJS

If you want to peek at the item icons when hovering, install and run the IconExporter mod. Not installing the mod will not make the extension unusable.\n\n\n### Usage\n\nInstall the mod, run \"/probejs dump\" in your game in the singleplayer, then open your .minecraft in VSCode as a folder.\n\nThe .minecraft folder is the parent folder of the KubeJS folder.\n\nType docs and autocompletion should appear when you open the js files under the KubeJS folder.\n\nAlso, try to type like @item or @block to see snippets generated.\n\n \n\n*In case nothing shows up in VSCode, check that:*\n\n- Many JSON files started with \"probe\" in the .vscode folder are under your .minecraft folder.\n- There is a \"probe\" folder under the KubeJS folder, and many files ending with \".d.ts\" are in the folder.\n- None of the \".d.ts\" files have syntax errors VSCode indicates.\n \n\nIf all three steps are correct, you might need to configure your VSCode to make it accept how ProbeJS dumps the typing, or just the VSCode can't handle the JS project created by ProbeJS.\n\nIf any steps fail, especially step 3, please submit an issue to

7.0.0","version_number":"7.0.0","changelog":"## v7.0.0\n\n- Final release for Minecraft 1.20.1\n- Dropped Fabric support\n- Completely rewritten the codebase to allow better codegen\n\n### TypeScript Generation\n\n- Declaration files are now generated in a per-script type manner.\n- You can only have type hinting for bindings you have in corresponding script types.\n- Typing generation folder is moved to `.minecraft/.probe` instead of `.minecraft/kubejs/probe`.\n- Each script folder will now have its own `jsconfig.json` and `src` folder.\n\n### Java Class Dumping\n\n- Largely sanitized the generated Java declarations, it now works in a nearly TS-compatible manner.\n- Java classes are now arraged in their corresponding package as modules, instead of being prefixed with `Internal.`.\n- Reacheable classes are now all visible with the VSCode JS/TS extension.\n\n### `require` and `import` Statements\n\n- As the module-based TypeScript generation is now implemented, CommonJS `require` and ESM `import` statements are now supported.\n- `require` is an alias of `Java.tryLoadClass`, and can be implemented without the installation of ProbeJS.\n- `import` is transpiled by ProbeJS to `require` statements using mixins, so it will *break* if you don't have ProbeJS installed.\n- `require` and `import` statements enable VSCode to auto-import classes you needed in your script.\n- Transpile of `import` statements is only able to process single-line imports, and will not work with `import * as ident from ...`.\n- `Java.loadClass` dumping support is removed in favor of `require` statements.\n\n### `export` Statements\n\n- To prevent namespace pollution, ProbeJS will isolate the identifiers for each script by default.\n- You can declare `const ident = ...` for each script without the need to worry about the global scope now with isolation.\n- To make a variable or function available to other scripts, you can use the `export` statement: `export const/var/let/function ident ..`.\n- Can be disabled by `/probejs scope_isolation`.\n- `export` statements are stripped by mixin, so you can't use them without ProbeJS.\n\n### Snippets\n\n- Added a few snippets: `#uuid`, `#ignored`, `#itemstack`, `#packmode`, `#priority`, `#recipes`, `#requires`.\n- `@-` snippets now include `@mod`, `@lang_key`, `@recipe_id`, and `@texture`.\n- Added `ProbeEvents.snippets` to allow you to add your own snippets.\n\n### Document Generation\n\n- Documents to Java classes is now accessible from Java and JS side.\n- Removed the need of downloading document files from the remote server.\n- Added `ProbeEvents.assignType` and `ProbeEvents.modifyClass` to allow you to modify the generated Java classes.\n\n### Decompilation\n\n- Now includes a runtime Java decompiler (Vineflower) to allow you to decompile classes in-game.\n- Obfuscated classes will be remapped to their deobfuscated names.\n- Decompilation will provide class info to ProbeJS, allowing you to use `require` for almost any Java class.\n- Set `probejs.enableDecompiler` to `true` and `probejs.modHash` to `-1` to trigger decompilation at next dump.\n\n### Linting\n\n- Added `/probejs lint` to perform linting on your scripts.\n- Linting will check for non-JS problems in your scripts. Like the redeclaration of exported variables, `import` conflict due to priorities, etc.\n- Auto-linting by interop with VSCode will be implemented in 1.21.\n\n### VSCode Extension\n\n- Does not require the installation of ProbeJS extension for any features now.\n- Extension will be rewritten to support a different set of features.\n\n### Forge Events\n\n- Literal support for Forge events is removed in favor of `require` event classes directly.\n\n![7](https://github.com/Prunoideae/ProbeJS/assets/24620047/f8d7cf86-ddbe-4ba5-a3c0-93f2934f797b)\n![6](https://github.com/Prunoideae/ProbeJS/assets/24620047/abd6457e-f6d0-4f44-b234-c4c610b1836e)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-18T09:30:41.254877Z","downloads":1605,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b10620235e860ef293be856c05d9f7c50a17813b898f18b4534cbf25c4da4e97494be98e460a98a449f05ba1c10e29d00aca62ac27f72138057cda1e72a22eee","sha1":"77e3583413568ea27745aeffb2bfc3b0128238ee"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JJNYRb4B/versions/oiljyqSe/probejs-7.0.0-forge.jar","filename":"probejs-7.0.0-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":4342166,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"umyGl7zF","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"probejs-6.0.0-forge.jar"},"mods\\funkyfluids-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"639d8717ddde8c233e4a5a79e75e9f0e7bb2b72dc3b2e25b659f75d2e3da279d4801c97aee2f4281bb34838d558befbf54e6069673e2b660fe096b1c55c6332b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"G0RU3iXJ","slug":"funky-fluids","project_type":"mod","team":"PJggWaAO","title":"Funky Fluids","description":"Adds various fluids with interesting and weird properties.","body":"Funky Fluids is a mod that adds various fluids with interesting and weird properties.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0PWam5wx4-I\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  \n\nThis is a list of all the fluids it adds:\n### Oobleck\nA non-newtonian fluid that increases in viscosity the more force you apply to it.

API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"# Discontinued as of 1.21\n\nThis project will not be officially ported for 1.21 and above. For reasons and further details, please check the [thread](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/427) on GitHub. Current versions for 1.20.6 and below will still receive updates and support for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor alternative accessory APIs and unofficial continuations available for 1.21, please see:\n\n- [Accessories (alternative API with a Curios compatibility layer)](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories)\n- [Curios API Continuation (Curios-based API)](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios-continuation)\n\n# Overview\n\nCurios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [Setting Up the Development Environment](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/getting-started)\n* [Slots](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/category/slots)\n* [Example Datapack](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/slots/datapack-example)\n* [Slots Configuration](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/configuration)\n* [Commands](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/commands)\n* [Legacy Documentation for 1.19.x and Below](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-07-02T08:25:22.316663Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1769573,"followers":387,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG","1aZiIHQO","nRQ4FbAf","UfNitWgy","AQ384Hch","1C6lBZmu","L0Tw2xgL","7Wei6s2K","9ro67WYY","adn5hcLm","TOk3Lved","WHmuOhGH","kKPFv8aa","DmFR6XO3","nJQvdzJp","YGa5gGxr","6EgL0aP4","7UxKaIU0","nyvHHyUE","wlGMHF77","29pH8hdz","CP6RHJq7","BiiqnvUy","suXbeF6v","tF9CH5Oa","TeuWjj6h","78rIk4rg","Ao2ykrAI","d3pyf6MJ","moWmAnjY","PEjKT9iG","LlDgDtwS","3XX6mBZ8","g5BlLWVo","LP78nWgP","REeqT3om","uV8dKuBO","NQfh5LGq","iLBQZb4J","S9Xq7LzJ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"moWmAnjY","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-5.9.1+1.20.1","version_number":"5.9.1+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\nPrior to version 5.2.0, this project used [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

Documentation\n-----------------------------------------\n\nModonomicon is an in-game documentation mod inspired by Thaumcraft's Thaumonomicon and Patchouli, and aims to provide the best of both, with some unique flavors.\n\nSome of the most interesting features are:\n\n* Fully data-driven, all books are created via datapack (that means both Modpacks and Mods can add books).\n* Patchouli-like Multiblocks (but fully data driven)\n* Made to be extensible, mods can add new features, such as recipe pages for mod-specific crafting methods.\n* \"Quest/Advancement\"-style 2D view to navigate the content, as seen in the Thaumonomicon.\n* Extensible condition system to unlock entries.\n* Easy styling of content with (extended) Markdown syntax.\n* Various page types to display text, recipes, images, items and more.\n\n### Visit the [Documentation](https://klikli-dev.github.io/modonomicon/) to get started!\n\n### License & Use in Modpacks\n\nModonomicon is licensed under the MIT License

These sequences are \"regular\" recipes that are supported.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createCrushing([\n  '2x minecraft:cobblestone',\n  'minecraft:redstone',\n  Item.of('minecraft:redstone').withChance(0.5)\n], 'minecraft:redstone_ore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:polished_rose_quartz'\n]).superheated()\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createFilling('create:blaze_cake', [\n  'create:blaze_cake_base',\n  Fluid.of('minecraft:lava', 250)\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createEmptying([\n  'minecraft:glass_bottle',\n  Fluid.of('create:honey', 250)\n], 'minecraft:honey_bottle')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting('minecraft:piston', [\n  'CCCCC',\n  'CPIPC',\n  'CPRPC'\n], {\n  C: '#forge:cobblestone',\n  P: '#minecraft:planks',\n  R: '#forge:dusts/redstone',\n  I: '#forge:ingots/iron'\n})\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly([ // start the recipe\n Item.of('6x create:large_cogwheel').withChance(32.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n Item.of('create:brass_ingot').withChance(2.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n 'minecraft:andesite', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'create:cogwheel', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:stick', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:iron_nugget' // have this item be a guaranteed output\n], 'create:brass_ingot', [ // 'create:brass_ingot' is the input.\n// the transitional item set by \"transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel')\" is the item that will be used during the recipe as the item that the input is using to transition to the output.\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:planks']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:wooden_buttons']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n event.recipes.createCutting('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', 'create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').processingTime(50) // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n]).transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').loops(6) // set the transitional item and the loops (amount of repetitions)\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own transitional item in sequenced_assembly recipes, you must register it in startup event:\n\n```javascript\nonEvent('item.registry', event => {\n  // Texture for this item goes in kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/item/my_part.png\n  event.create('my_part', 'create:sequenced_assembly').displayName('My Part')\n})\n```\n\nThen you would use ...`transitionalItem('kubejs:my_part')`...\n\n> Note! Mysterious Conversion recipes are client side only, so the only way to add them currently is using reflection with this code in client scripts (outside any event):\n\n```javascript\nlet MysteriousItemConversionCategory = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.category.MysteriousItemConversionCategory')\nlet ConversionRecipe = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.ConversionRecipe')\n\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:apple', 'minecraft:carrot'))\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:golden_apple', 'minecraft:golden_carrot'))\n```\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)","published":"2023-08-21T20:20:41.279415Z","updated":"2023-11-20T15:07:35.257690Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":165044,"followers":38,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["MO75e2sC","YN0T5Pmf","dvLO7wuv","T4V6Dm0l","cNEVOQ4q","bnvthbJW","uMNhEyBG","79c3Pl6W","VwLRcUBQ","Khlo8swW","b3ZbuHEY","eRR2DuIi","CDoBzOhr","qmHwp7h4","gUgBKKro","r6cVLbDS","I3cYQ3mX","pLyqKVXT","ftDL2MOo","XABryG8V","VszJSnhB","1INYEb9w","oRValdcl","mHfUZDSO","m9lk8iMr","65oHVwN8","VLiijTOY","rJ26X7G5","2Hq8tbrn","dxY7VzQv","zWLaf3WR","Yp60zntL","B4zWSIIO","8qUQlsto","zmzcrZEp","y7FC6Rsp","YE9yQwxx","353BVKVV","hYdnSDQB","13yE1QX6","Jqn5DRIj","A0KQFxde","Xe2y2pRp","FhVbUfLB","ClnUsQ85","HJ0xIlkM","PB33MOc1","hei9cDRa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T38eAZQC/1bbef73c4dbe0da7e29b6e1cdfc01545bd7febe1.png"},"version":{"id":"hei9cDRa","project_id":"T38eAZQC","author_id":"7tgPcl7v","featured":false,"name":"KubeJS Create Forge 2001.2.5-build.2","version_number":"2001.2.5-build.2+forge","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-20T15:07:36.181602Z","downloads":119628,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"629756b7d6504fe4d989ce60a5ca785ab2ad17dc018d4766a437d7b2b384db9c5930c257c484874168c8f832f4503d174e13513dce16c4b983e0e141f1b95250","sha1":"b5548110822245de13c7adf1d10e00ecab9cd633"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T38eAZQC/versions/hei9cDRa/kubejs-create-forge-2001.2.5-build.2.jar","filename":"kubejs-create-forge-2001.2.5-build.2.jar","primary":true,"size":31216,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"umyGl7zF","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"p2d14DeK","user":{"id":"Ud4jzpdg","username":"simibubi","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31564874?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-07T19:36:11.027713Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Parent Mod Author","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"kubejs-create-forge-2001.2.5-build.2.jar"},"mods\\lootjs-forge-1.20.1-2.12.0.jar":{"sha512":"50d79869601a81375fcb5d60635abbb901770107c675e07a0d5aade4c235bb3ff6879310b821583df856fa034b839045ae5f5fe7d543280195c4c2405b83dc4f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fJFETWDN","slug":"lootjs","project_type":"mod","team":"PMRuK7v3","title":"LootJS: KubeJS Addon","description":"A Minecraft mod for packdevs to easily modify the loot system with KubeJS.","body":"## **📑 Overview**\nThis is a mod for Forge or Fabric and needs [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs).<br>\n\n\n## **✏️ Your first loot modification**\nLoot modifications are handled server side. So all your scripts will go into your `your_minecraft_instance/kubejs/server_scripts` directory. Just create a `.js` file and let's get started.\n\nHere's simple example which adds a gunpowder for creepers:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addEntityLootModifier(\"minecraft:creeper\")\n        .randomChance(0.3) // 30% chance\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gunpowder\");\n});\n```\n\nInstead of using a loot table for reference, you can also apply the modification to all entities:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addLootTypeModifier(LootType.ENTITY) // you also can use multiple types\n        .logName(\"It's raining loot\") // you can set a custom name for logging\n        .weatherCheck({\n            raining: true,\n        })\n        .thenModify(Ingredient.getAll(), (itemStack) => {\n            // you have to return an item!\n            return itemStack.withCount(itemStack.getCount() * 2);\n        });\n});\n```\n\nNext, let's check if the player holds a specific item:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addBlockLootModifier(\"#forge:ores\") // keep in mind this is a block tag not an item tag\n        .matchEquip(EquipmentSlot.MAINHAND, Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gravel\");\n\n    // for MainHand and OffHand you can also use:\n    // matchMainHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n    // matchOffHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n});\n```\n\n## **⚙️ More Information**\nFor more

About\n\nWarning: Botania **Requires [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) and [Curios (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) or [Trinkets (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)!**  \n\n**Botania** is a tech mod themed around natural magic. Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://botaniamod.net/index.html)**\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)- -
